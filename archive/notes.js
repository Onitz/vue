Vue instance + template(html)
By instanciating this instance, you

Vuejs does not use htmlcode at runtime. 
  It creates a template based on htmlcode, 
  stores internally, 
  then renders real html code to the DOM
There is this VueJs layer instance in the middle
{{ /*you can execute functions and eval expressions here */ }}
<p>{{ sayHello() }}</p>

^in the template, we have access to everything stored in:
  data
  methods
  (because vuejs proxies them for us)
  we can call this. anywhere in our Vue Instance object
  to get access to any of our vue properties

{{brace notation does not work in attributes!}}
v-DIRECTIVE
  <a v-bind:href="link">link to Dabson</a>
  permits binding dynamic data to html attributes

MUST DO DOUBLE QUOTES IN git commit -m "commit message"
{{ braceNotation }} is parsed as text

v-html="finishedLink" tells vue to parse data.finishedLin as html
      finishedLink: '<a href="https://dabson.co">Dbs</a>'

v-bind: binds model data -> html template 
v-on:   binds template event -> model data

    [[ this is the 2-way data binding ]]

                                                                            methods{
                                                                              updateCoords: function(event) {
                                                                                this.x = event.clientX;
                                                                                this.y = event.clientY;
                                                                              },
                                                                              increase: function(step) {
                                                                                this.countr += step;
                                                                              }
                                                                            }
$event lets y ou manually pass in the event object to multi-input functions
<span v-on:mousemove.stop="">DEAD SPOT</span>
v-on:mousemove.stop.propegate

v-on:keyup.stop 

'.stop' is the event modifier

<input v-on:keyup.enter="submit">
<input @keyup.enter="submit">

.enter 
.tab 
.delete 
.esc 
.space 
.up 
.down 
.left 
.right

can evaluate simple javascript statements in v-on:click 
"simple" = no if / for etc
templates really are a mixture of js + html 

{{ template expressions }}
reactivity, 
true power of the framework comes in when having to listen to all our datapoints and respond 
lots of complex interactions would get incredibly verbose & soupy with ie jquery 

v-model: 2WAY!
  v-bind: model -> html
  v-on:   event -> model

vuejs makes it easier to model cross-property dependencies

DATA IS NOT REACTIVE,
so data{ result: this.counter++}
MUST NOT NAME DATA properties same as METHODS

Known options for vue instance 
  el: Connect to DOM 
  data: store data to be used 
  methods: methods of this vue instance 
  computed: dependent properties 

es6 syntax:
  result() {...}

es5 syntax:
  result: function() {...}

computed{ output } is not called like a function, its used as a property
evertyhing stored in computed can be used like something stored in the data object 
only, COMPUTED IS REACTIVE
computed is preffered cause its caching the result instead of recalculating

computed: setup the property, then set a function how it should be computed 
computed is better optimised than watch
