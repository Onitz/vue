Vue instance + template(html)
By instanciating this instance, you

Vuejs does not use htmlcode at runtime. 
  It creates a template based on htmlcode, 
  stores internally, 
  then renders real html code to the DOM
There is this VueJs layer instance in the middle
{{ /*you can execute functions and eval expressions here */ }}
<p>{{ sayHello() }}</p>

^in the template, we have access to everything stored in:
  data
  methods
  (because vuejs proxies them for us)
  we can call this. anywhere in our Vue Instance object
  to get access to any of our vue properties
